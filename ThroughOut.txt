-Intro: Training with data for a purpose
-Data mining: Collecting data from large data area.
-Types: 1.Supervised learning
        2.Unsupervised
        3.Reinforcement
-Supervised: --Training data with label
 --Based on testing data

-Unsupervised: No label given.
  --All data given for training. Labelled based on similarity which is created by the system.
-Reinforcemnt:
  --Feedback obtained during running and this is used to catagorize data.
   --eg:chess(cant predit next movemnt)
   --realtime data training

-Algorthm must be anallyzed.
-Ml can be done in any language.
-For python,IDLE-- Software:Anaconda has many libraries,packages for ml.
-Enabling python for Anaconda
-hello world in python
-Preprocessing: data needs to be preprocessed before training.
-numpy: create arrays
-ski-learn: pre functions and packages available for ml. 
   ::preprocessing.  from sklearn import preprocessing  - preprocessing.x 
       - use 'as' for abbreviation for 
-Mean removal, standard deviation
-scale :standard,minmap,organised

standard:data scaled to 0 , standard deviation as 1
minmap: scaled to a range (0 to 1), 

-Normalizer L1,L2
  l1:least absolute deviation l2:least squares
l1: result of normalisation is an array.. and the absolute sum of row is always 1
l2: result is an array... square of each element in a row and sum them we get 1.

- Normalised class in preprocessing
 we create object and pass data to get l1 normalization
